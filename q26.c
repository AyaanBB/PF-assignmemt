In this scenario, a while loop is the most effective loop system for several reasons:

1. The while loop continuously evaluates a condition (input != 0), making it perfect for open-ended tasks where the number of iterations is unknown.

2. Unlike for loops, while loops don't require a fixed number of iterations, allowing the loop to adapt to user input.

3. After each iteration, the while loop checks user input to determine whether to continue or terminate.

4. While loops handle uncertain or variable numbers of iterations with ease.
